        "intro_text": "You stand before two colossal brass doors, humming with a deep red energy. The air smells of ozone and rust. An inscription above the gate reads: 'Only fury may enter.' There is no handle, no lock, only a solid, imposing barrier between you and the trial ahead.",

        "intro_text": "The doors grind open into a circular chamber. In the center, a pressure plate is surrounded by four stone statues of mythical beasts: a Serpent, a Wolf, a Bear, and an Eagle. As you step inside, the statues grind to life, their eyes glowing malevolently. The far door is sealed tight, with a carving above it depicting the same four beasts in a specific sequence.",

          "type": "COMBAT_PUZZLE",
          "description": "The door will only open if the statues are defeated in the correct order depicted on the archway: Serpent, Wolf, Bear, Eagle. Defeating them out of sequence causes them all to regenerate.",

        "intro_text": "Beyond the statue room lies a deep, dark chasm, fifty feet across. A howling wind rushes up from its depths. On the far side, you can see the ornate entrance to the throne room. A narrow, crumbling stone bridge, slick with moss, is the only obvious way across, but it looks incredibly unstable.",

        "intro_text": "You enter a grand, torch-lit hall. At the far end, a hulking figure in jagged, crimson armor sits on a throne of obsidian. He rises slowly, grabbing a massive, two-handed axe. 'You have strength,' his voice booms from his helmet. 'But you lack the will to rule. Prove me wrong.'",
